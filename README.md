Problem Statement- Predict Hospital Readmission Risk for Patients with Chronic Conditions
                 ( Hospital readmissions, especially among patients with chronic illnesses (like diabetes, heart disease, or hypertension), 
                  are a major challenge for the healthcare system.
                  Early identification of patients at high risk of readmission allows providers to intervene and improve outcomes.)

Project Overview- (1) Develop an AI-powered predictive analytics dashboard that identifies patients with chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, etc.)
                   who are at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge.
                   (2)Patient Risk Assessment:
                      ->Input patient demographics, medical history, lab results, and hospitalization details.
                      ->Predict the likelihood (%) of readmission using machine learning.
                   (3)Risk Stratification & Visualization:
                       ->High Risk (Red): >60% chance of readmission
                       ->Medium Risk (Orange): 30-60% chance
                       ->Low Risk (Green): <30% chance
                       ->Interactive charts showing key risk factors (e.g., age, comorbidities, test results).
                    (4)Preventive Recommendations:
                        ->Alerts for high-risk patients needing immediate intervention.
                    (5)Analytics Dashboard:
                        ->Trends in readmission rates by condition, age, and gender.
                        ->Comparison of risk factors across patient groups.    
      Technicla Approach:
                      (1)Data Used:
                        ->Patient age, gender, chronic conditions, lab results, admission type, medications, billing info.
                        ->Historical readmission records (if available).
                      (2)Model Development:
                        ->Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
                        ->Risk Score Calculation: Probability (%) of readmission.
                 Impact:
                      (1)Reduces unnecessary readmissions by flagging high-risk patients early.
                      (2)Improves care coordination with targeted interventions.
                      (3)Lowers healthcare costs by preventing avoidable hospital stays.
     Future Enhancements:
                      (1)Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR) for automated data input.
                      (2)Real-time alerts to care teams via SMS/email.
                      (3)Expanded chronic condition coverage (COPD, kidney disease, etc.).
